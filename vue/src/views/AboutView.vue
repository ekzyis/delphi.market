    <h1>Prediction what?</h1>
    <div class="mx-1">
      Prediction markets are awesome! In prediction markets, traders bet on the outcome of events.
      Political elections are the classic examples. Watch <a target="_blank"

    <h1>When mainnet?</h1>
    <div class="mx-1">
      Currently, the market is running on
      <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.mutinywallet.com/mutinynet/">mutinynet</a> since it's still WIP.
      This means that sats traded on here don't have any real value yet and you need to use the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://faucet.mutinywallet.com/">mutiny faucet</a> to pay invoices. When I am confident
      that there are no (serious) bugs, I will use a lightning node connected to mainnet. However, no ETA yet.
